2. How websites work?
   User enters website in the address bar
   Browser searches the cache for the associated IP address of the website (browser cache, os cache, router cache, ISP cache).
   If not found in the cache, ISP's DNS server queries for the IP address (of the server hosting the website) and returns it.
   Browser establishes a TCP connection with the server in that IP address.
   Issues a HTTP request for the resources.
   Server returns the requested resources as response.
   HTML Parser, CSS Parser, and JS engines residing in the browser converts
   this response in to meaningful data and displays on the web page in a form understandable by end user.
